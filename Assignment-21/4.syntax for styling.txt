4. syntax for styling an element?

To style an HTML element using CSS, you need to apply CSS rules to the element or select it using CSS selectors. The basic syntax for styling an element is as follows:

selector {
    property: value;
    /* Additional properties and values */
}

selector: This is a CSS selector that specifies which HTML elements the styles should be applied to. For example, you can use an element selector like h1 to target all <h1> elements or a class selector like .my-class to target elements with a specific class.

property: This is the CSS property you want to apply to the selected elements. CSS properties define what aspect of the element you want to style, such as color for text color or font-size for text size.

value: This is the value you want to assign to the CSS property. It specifies how you want the selected elements to look. For example, `red` for the color property or 16px for the font-size property.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to style a heading element (<h1>) with CSS:

h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bold;
}


ex:

The h1 selector targets all <h1> elements.
The color property sets the text color to blue.
The font-size property sets the font size to 24 pixels.
The font-weight property makes the text bold.

You can include multiple properties and values within the curly braces to apply multiple styles to the selected element(s).
