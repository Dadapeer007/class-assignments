2. How to add css sheets to the html document
To add CSS stylesheets to an HTML document, there are several methods you can use. The most common methods include:

a.External CSS File:

   Create a separate CSS file with a .css extension, such as `styles.css`.
   In the HTML document, inside the `<head>` section, use the `<link>` element to link to the external CSS file. Here's an example:

     html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
     </head>
     <body>
         <!-- Your HTML content here -->
     </body>
     </html>
Make sure to replace `"styles.css"` with the actual path to your CSS file.

b.Internal CSS:

 In the HTML document, you can include CSS rules directly within a `<style>` element in the `<head>` section. Here's an example:

     html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <style>
             /* CSS rules go here */
             body {
                 background-color: #f0f0f0;
             }
             h1 {
                 color: #333;
             }
         </style>
     </head>
     <body>
         <!-- Your HTML content here -->
     </body>
     </html>

CSS rules defined within the `<style>` element apply only to the HTML document in which they are defined.

c.Inline CSS:

 You can also apply CSS directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute. Here's an example:

     html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1 style="color: blue;">This is a blue heading</h1>
         <p style="font-size: 16px;">This is a paragraph with a custom font size.</p>
     </body>
     </html>
Inline CSS applies styles to a specific element and takes precedence over external and internal CSS.
