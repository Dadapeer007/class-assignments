3. what is DOM?

The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface and representation of structured documents, such as HTML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated in a programming environment, typically through scripting languages.

a.Structured Representation: The DOM represents an HTML document as a tree-like structure, where each element, attribute, and piece of text in the document is a node in the tree. This tree structure makes it possible to navigate and manipulate the content of a document using programming languages.

b.Document Hierarchy:The top-level node in the DOM tree is typically the "document" object, which represents the entire web page document. Below the document object, there are nodes representing elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`), attributes (e.g., `src`, `href`), and text content within the document.

c.Access and Manipulation: Developers can use scripting languages like JavaScript to access and manipulate elements and content within the DOM. This allows for dynamic web page behavior, such as updating content, responding to user interactions, and modifying styles.

d.Event Handling: The DOM provides a mechanism for handling events like clicks, keyboard input, and mouse movements. Developers can attach event listeners to DOM elements to execute code in response to specific events, creating interactive web applications.

e.Dynamic Updates:One of the key strengths of the DOM is its ability to reflect changes made to the document in real-time. When a developer modifies the DOM through scripting, those changes are immediately reflected in the rendered web page.

e.Cross-Platform:The DOM is not limited to a specific programming language or platform. While it's commonly used with JavaScript in web browsers, it can also be used with other programming languages and in non-browser environments.
