5.How to iterate over an array? Explain with an example.
ans:
The ieratetion can be possible while haveing loops. normally there are two types of loops.
a.for loop
b.while loop

ex: array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
To get an length of an array there are using build in function called arr.len.
By using the loop of the array from initial value of index from zero to total length of array.
Frist create an variable to store the index values like let i=0.
Additionally to compare the arr.length if condition is true it executed  
And some value is I will be increment as per reequipment.
Here's an example that demonstrates how to iterate over an array using only a for loop:

ex:  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
In this example, the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is used. 
The for loop iterates from index 0 to index length - 1 (0 to 4 in this case). 
Inside the loop, the current element is accessed using the current index (array[i]). 
In this example, the elements are simply printed to the console using console.log(element)
