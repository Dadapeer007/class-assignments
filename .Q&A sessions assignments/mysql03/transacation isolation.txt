Transaction isolation levels in a relational database management system (RDBMS) determine how concurrent transactions interact with each other and how they perceive the data modifications made by other transactions. 

they can set the transaction isolation level using the `SET TRANSACTION` statement. Here's the syntax for changing the isolation level:

SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL isolation_level;

Replace `isolation_level` with one of the isolation level names (e.g., 'READ UNCOMMITTED', 'READ COMMITTED', 'REPEATABLE READ', 'SERIALIZABLE').

Here are some examples of how to set the isolation level:

-- Set the isolation level to READ COMMITTED
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

-- Set the isolation level to SERIALIZABLE
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
