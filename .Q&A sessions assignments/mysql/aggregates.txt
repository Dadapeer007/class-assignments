Aggregate functions in SQL are functions that operate on a set of values and return a single value as a result.
These functions allow you to perform calculations on groups of rows, such as calculating sums, averages, counts, minimum values, and maximum values. Aggregate functions are commonly used with the `GROUP BY` clause to perform calculations on subsets of data within a table.

1. COUNT():Counts the number of rows in a group.

   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
   
2. SUM():Calculates the sum of a numeric column in a group.

   SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;

3. AVG():Calculates the average of a numeric column in a group.
   
   SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
   
4. MIN():Returns the minimum value in a group.
   
   SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;
  
5. MAX():Returns the maximum value in a group.

   SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
  
6. GROUP_CONCAT():Concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string.

   SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(product_name SEPARATOR ', ') FROM products;

7. HAVING:Used in conjunction with `GROUP BY` to filter groups based on aggregate conditions.

   SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
   FROM employees
   GROUP BY department
   HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
