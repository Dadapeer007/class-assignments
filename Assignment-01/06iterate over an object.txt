6.How to iterate over an object data? Explain with an example.
Ans:
To iterate over an object's data, you typically need to access the object's properties or keys and then process the corresponding values.

•	Determine the type of object: Objects can take different forms, such as dictionaries, arrays, or custom classes. Understanding the object's structure will help you choose the appropriate iteration method.
•	Identify the iteration mechanism: Most programming languages provide built-in iteration mechanisms like loops or iterators. You will need to select the one that suits your needs.
•	Access the object's properties: Depending on the object's type, you may access its properties directly or use specific methods/functions to retrieve them.
•	Iterate over the properties: Use the chosen iteration mechanism to loop over the object's properties. The specific syntax and methods vary between languages, but here are a few examples:
•	For loops: Use a `for` loop to iterate over the object's properties, typically using an index variable to access each property in turn.
for (var key in object) 
{
var value = object[key];
}

•	Process the property values: Within the iteration loop, you can access and manipulate the object's property values as needed. Perform any desired operations, calculations, or data transformations using the current property value.
