7. what is a constructor?
The constructor is a special function that is used to create and initialize objects. Constructors are typically defined as regular functions but are invoked with the `new` keyword to create instances of objects, often referred to as "instances" or "objects" themselves. Constructors are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming and provide a way to define the blueprint for objects of a specific type or class.

example:

// Define a constructor function for a 'Person' object
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Create instances (objects) using the constructor
const person1 = new Person("John", 30);
const person2 = new Person("Jane", 25);

// Accessing the properties of instances
console.log(person1.name); // Output: "John"
console.log(person2.age);  // Output: 25

In this example:

1. We define a constructor function called `Person` that takes `name` and `age` as parameters. Inside the constructor, we use the `this` keyword to refer to the newly created object.
2. We create two instances (`person1` and `person2`) using the `new` keyword followed by the constructor function. This invokes the constructor and initializes the properties of each instance.
3. We can access the properties of each instance using dot notation (`objectName.propertyName`).
