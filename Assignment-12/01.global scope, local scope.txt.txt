1. What is the difference between global scope, local scope in JavaScript?

Global Scope:

*Variables and functions declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in your JavaScript code, including inside functions and other blocks.
*Variables declared outside of any function or block are automatically placed in the global scope.
*Global variables are generally declared using the var, let, or const keywords outside of any function or block.


Local Scope (Function Scope):

*Variables declared inside a function are scoped to that function and are not accessible outside of it.
*This helps prevent naming conflicts and provides encapsulation for variables.
