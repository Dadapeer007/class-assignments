4. what is binary search tree?

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, and the nodes are arranged in such a way.

All nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value.
All nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
Binary search trees are often used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations
